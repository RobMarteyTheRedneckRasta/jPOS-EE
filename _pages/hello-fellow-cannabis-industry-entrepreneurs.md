Welcome to the Cannabisys.com.

Initially this domain was being used for a virtual company that was mentioned in the book, Pin Prick. Now that the book has been published, the initial function of the domain is now void.

At this time the domain is being set up for a OpenSource project that involves refining and enhancing the jPos application to support all retail operation workflows for the industry. Including regulatory implementations as they occur. 

This project will be titled as jointPOS. It's not only a pun, but will be a true joint effort. And it will jointly benefit those involved, including retail operators who don't have the financial means to acquire an expensive POS system prior to actually bringing in revenue.

As this site evolves, please feel free to give me a shout with any questions or interest in being involved with this project.

The repository will be be located on Github with a fork being produced from either;
https://github.com/jpos/jPOS-EE/blob/master/doc/src/asciidoc/getting_started.adoc
or 
https://github.com/jpos/jPOS

Once the most viable base version is identified, the fork will be created, and the Summary sync posted under this site. Anyone contributing to the project will have access to the cannabisys.com website for collaboration and roadmap updates.

On the horizon, we see production and cultivation management applications/systems as our next project. We plan on having that conversation sometime in the future, once jointPOS is available as a beta release.

If you are interested, contact me through the site email form with your relative information, and your potential contribution to the project overall. 

Thanks for your time and consideration!

Best regards,
Chris Conger
