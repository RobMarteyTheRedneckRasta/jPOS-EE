Welcome to Cannabisys.com.

Where, it's just time to create the EPIC for Cannabis standards, and reasonable government oversight

At this time the domain is being set up for a Open-source project that involves refining and enhancing the POS application to support all retail operation work-flows for the industry. Including regulatory implementations as they occur.

This project will be titled as cannaPOS.. And yes, we know that is unnecessarily blatant, as Project naming goes, with consideration to those who don't support legalization...
Seriously, isn't it time to get rid of the stigmatization and push it into the "main stream" kinda mentality.Â If we don't. Politians and corporate entites will refine existing laws to inhibit smaller companies to compete.

It took 80 years to brand cannabis/hemp in a negative way. Hopefully, it won't take that long to re-educate fellow humans.

It will jointly effort (sorry, bad pun..) but it will benefit those involved, If not for the personal gratification of debating in the defense of your own core beliefs. Including retail operators who don't have the financial means to acquire an expensive POS system prior to actually bringing in sustainable revenue.

As this site evolves, please feel free to give me a shout with any questions or interest in being involved with this project.

The repository will be be located on Git-hub with a fork being produced from either;
https://github.com/jpos/jPOS-EE/blob/master/doc/src/asciidoc/getting_started.adoc
or
https://github.com/jpos/jPOS

Once the most viable base version is identified, the fork will be created, and the Summary sync posted under this site. Anyone contributing to the project will have access to the cannabisys.com website for collaboration and road-map updates.

On the horizon, we see production and cultivation management applications/systems as our next project. We plan on having that conversation sometime in the future, once cannaPos is available as a beta release.

If you are interested, contact me through the site email form with your relative information, and your potential contribution to the project overall.

Thanks for your time and consideration!

Best regards,
Chris Conger
