Whether you're going in to cultivation, processing, or retail sales. You will need equipment.
For long term viability and efficient usage, we strongly recommend purchasing new equipment from reputable dealers.

If you start out using cheap or low quality equipment, and consumable supplies. The resulting product will be your new customers first impression. If that's a risk you are taking because of the budget, that's a different story.
Otherwise, you may not want to buy used, off-name, or what is considered 'fixable equipment'. Unless you are willing to put in the sweat-equity to make up for limited start-up funds..
Maintenance and repair of equipment is not your core business. But it may be a tool to getting it all going for the long term - so do what you have too... =]

Be careful you don't overwhelm yourself while setting up your business by creating a bunch of projects for your team. This may take away from your customer service bandwidth. Managerial time with staff, and give a bad impression to customers who have to wait..

New, ready to run equipment with manufacturer support, is the most stable way to start a new business in this industry. Having redundancy is also the best insurance policy. Especially for lighting. Since nutrients can be manually applied to hydro or soil in an emergency situation.
A good automatic back up power production system is the best approach. I prefer solar and batters, but that's another post..and a bigger budget..

Below are the types of equipment that may be considered when setting up a new business. Several categories overlap such as Security, Weights and Measurements, Reporting and Tracking, etc. So they're appears to be duplicates, but they are not. Each category should be considered a separate list as the types of equipment used for security in Cultivation, may not work effectively for Retail.

At a high-level, here are some things to consider as you approach the cannabis market;
<ol>
 	<li>Types of Facilities</li>
 	<li>Regional Regulations.</li>
 	<li>Equipment and Processes.</li>
 	<li>Transaction Recording and Reporting.</li>
 	<li>Hazardous Material.</li>
 	<li>Cannabis Facility Laws and Regulations.</li>
 	<li>Cannabis Construction Contract Administration.</li>
 	<li>Cannabis Facility Design and Occupant Comfort.</li>
 	<li>Cannabis Facility Building Systems.</li>
</ol>
